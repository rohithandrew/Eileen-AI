## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `openai`, `langchain`, and `python-dotenv` Python packages
- `.env` file with your OpenAI API key, Gmail address, and Gmail app password

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install openai langchain python-dotenv
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in your project directory and add the following:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   GMAIL_ADDRESS=your_gmail_address_here
   GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password_here
   ```

### Running Eileen

```bash
python eileen_chatbot.py
```

You'll be greeted by Eileen. Type your messages, and type `stop` to end the conversation.

## How Email Handling Works

- If your prompt includes a Gmail address, Eileen will use it to send the email.
- If only a name or non-Gmail address is provided, Eileen will help you draft the message and prompt you to provide the email address if needed.
- Eileen never assumes or generates email addressesâ€”she only uses what you provide.

## Customization

- **Model Selection:** Change the model in `init_chat_model` for different capabilities.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Adjust the prompt template for different personalities or behaviors.
- **Conversation Memory:** Enhance or persist `conversation_history` for longer-term memory.
